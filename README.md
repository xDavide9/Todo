# ToDo List

A _batch script_ that allows you to create a list of things to do identified by an id with which they can be deleted afterwards.

- Works only on _windows_
- Should be familiar with the _command line_
- Immediate access to the information

<hr>

When it comes to remember your daily tasks, a simple script written in the os own command line language without even bothering with a _gui_ is the fastest choice.

You might want to add the script to your path enviroment variable so that you can access it from any location.

Get Started with `todo /?`
